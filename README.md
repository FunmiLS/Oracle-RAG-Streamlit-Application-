# Oracle-RAG-Streamlit-Application

This repository showcases a demo implementation of the Oracle Microservices Sandbox. 
The tool allows developers and data scientists explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Using features from Oracle Database 23ai, like AI VectorSearch and SelectAI, the Sandbox helps users boost the performance of existing AI models.

## ⚠️ Challenges & Debugging Log

We discovered a few issues and bugs with the application when following the demo tutorial. The known issues and bugs are found below:

- **Open AI Credits**: If you choose to use OpenAI's free tier account, you will likely run out of credits quickly to generate embeddings and interact with the chat models.
- **Packages**: Some of the required packages are not running the latest versions. We advise manually installing the older versions to get the app to run.
